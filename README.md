# The Bandwidth Benchmark

This is a collection of simple streaming kernels for teaching purposes.

It consists of two banchmark applications:

* [MainMemory](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/TheBandwidthBenchmark/wiki/MainMemory)
* [MemoryHierarchy](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/TheBandwidthBenchmark/wiki/MemoryHierarchy)

Apart from the microbenchmarking functionality this is also a blueprint for other microbenchmarking applications.

It contains C modules for:
* Aligned data allocation
* Query and control affinity settings
* Accurate timing

Moreover the benchmark showcases a simple generic Makefile that can be used in other projects.
